# GT Fasta Files

The excel file ``GT_fasta_shorter.xlsx`` contains all the RNA sequences of the GT validation dataset.

Furthermore, it contains the **Short Sequence** and **Shorter Sequence**.
**Short Sequence** column contains the RNA sequence, shortened to only contain the visible part of the RNA.
**Shorter Sequence** column contains even more shortened RNA sequence, to only contain the CRISPR repeat part of the RNA.
