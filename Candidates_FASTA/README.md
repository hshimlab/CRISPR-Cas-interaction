# Candidate crRNAs

The candidate crRNAs of the Cas13a, Cas13b, and Cas13d are in the respective text files in fasta format.

The file ``cas13b_good_candidates.txt`` contains the unique crRNA sequences and only one name but the other file for Cas13b, ``cas13b_good_candidates_info.txt``. contains all the names of candidate crRNAs that share the same sequences.

For example, the CRISPR repeats CP022378_5_1 and CP022378_6_1 are noted down as follows:

```
>CP022378_5_1+CP022378_6_1
